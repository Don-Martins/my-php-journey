 PHP Data Types
Variables can store data of different types, and different data types can do different things.

PHP supports the following data types:

String
Integer
Float (floating point numbers - also called double)
Boolean
Array
Object
NULL
Resource


 1. A string can be any text inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes:
 2.An integer data type is a non-decimal number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647
 3.A float (floating point number) is a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form
 4.A Boolean represents two possible states: TRUE or FALSE.
 5.An array stores multiple values in one single variable.
 6.An object is a data type which stores data and information on how to process that data.
 7.Null is a special data type which can have only one value: NULL.
   A variable of data type NULL is a variable that has no value assigned to it.
 8.The special resource type is not an actual data type. It is the storing of a           reference to functions and resources external to PHP.
