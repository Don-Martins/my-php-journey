/*
  Echo and print are nearly the same thing because they are both used to output informations onthe screen 

  difference btw echo and print is that echo has no return value,it can take multiple parameters  while print has a return value of 1, and cannot take multiple parameters
*/

//echo
   $x="Obi";
   $color="Red";
   echo "$x is on $color";
   echo "<br>";

   //print
   $x="Obi";
   $color="Red";
   print "$x is on $color";
